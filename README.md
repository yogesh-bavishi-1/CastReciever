# CastReciever
A Linux/Cross-Platform app to receive cast from android device.  

Some hints of features:
Windows10 has got "connect" app wich receives cast from android device and also supports pc keyboard and mouse to controll android device while in cast. there should be no additional app to be installed on android.
